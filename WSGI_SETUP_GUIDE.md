# üîß HOW TO SET UP WSGI CONFIGURATION - NO FILE NEEDED!

## The WSGI "file" is created through PythonAnywhere's web interface

### STEP 1: Go to Web Tab
1. Open PythonAnywhere Dashboard
2. Click **"Web"** tab at the top

### STEP 2: Find Your Web App
Look for your web app: **rudchandryhodge.pythonanywhere.com**

If you don't have a web app yet:
1. Click **"Add a new web app"**
2. Choose **"Manual configuration"**  
3. Select **"Python 3.10"**

### STEP 3: Configure Source Code Path
In your web app configuration, find the section **"Code"**:
- Set **"Source code"** to: `/home/rudchandryhodge/pair-matcher`

### STEP 4: Configure WSGI File
In the **"Code"** section, you'll see:
**"WSGI configuration file"** with a path like:
`/var/www/rudchandryhodge_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py`

1. **Click on that path link** - it will open the file editor
2. **Delete ALL existing content** in that file
3. **Replace with this EXACT content:**

```python
import sys
import os

# Add project path
path = '/home/rudchandryhodge/pair-matcher'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, path)

# Import the FastAPI app
from main import application
```

4. **Click "Save"** (or Ctrl+S)

### STEP 5: Reload Web App
Back in the Web tab:
1. Click the green **"Reload rudchandryhodge.pythonanywhere.com"** button
2. Wait for it to finish

### STEP 6: Test Your API
Visit: **https://rudchandryhodge.pythonanywhere.com/**

You should see:
```json
{"message": "Product Matcher API is running!", "status": "success"}
```

## üìç IMPORTANT NOTES:

- The WSGI **"file"** is actually created/edited through the PythonAnywhere web interface
- You don't create it manually in the Files section
- The path is automatically generated when you create a web app
- Make sure your **Source code** path is set correctly: `/home/rudchandryhodge/pair-matcher`

## üö® If You Don't See WSGI Configuration File Link:
1. Make sure you created a **web app** first
2. Choose **"Manual configuration"** (not Flask/Django)
3. The WSGI file link will appear in the "Code" section
